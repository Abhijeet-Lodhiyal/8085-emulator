An emulator is a software or hardware tool that replicates the behavior of another system or device.
It allows a computer system (the host) to imitate the functions of a different computer system (the guest) or a piece of hardware.



I've developed an 8085 emulator that adopts a procedural methodology to determine the output of an 8085 program.

To start the program compile and run the eightzeroeightfive file.
